## Overview
In this challenge we were tasked with creating a webpage and table that would accept user input. The table was used to allow users to filter the data so that there could be a in-depth analysis. We added various filters to our table to make it as detailed as possible to provide the best user experience. 
## Results 
After going through our necessary files and editing them we can see if our webpage is responsive. The webpage is designed so that the user can select various items from the table and filter them accordingly.![data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mkhanali25/UFOs/main/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-11%20at%209.26.20%20PM.png) In the image you can see the various filters that the user can use to filter our table. We edited our html so that it can include the format for the filtering and we used our app.js so that the data can be inputed and filtered accoridingly.
## Summary
There were many challenges that I faced when trying to develop this webpage. The first challenge was trying to understand the code that was inside our html file, this was very challenging at first because it was so overwhelming. A drawback of the page was the way that its structured I believe that the page itself is unpleasant to look at as a user. We can always edit the page and its content to make it look more aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. The structure itself can use some work where we can have the table fill the page more. There are many other things we can do to make the webpage look and work better.
