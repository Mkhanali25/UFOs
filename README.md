## Overview
In this challenge we were tasked with creating a webpage and table that would accept user input. The table was used to allow users to filter the data so that there could be a in-depth analysis. We added various filters to our table to make it as detailed as possible to provide the best user experience. 
## Results 
After going through our necessary files and editing them we can see if our webpage is responsive. The webpage is designed so that the user can select various items from the table and filter them accordingly. 


Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
